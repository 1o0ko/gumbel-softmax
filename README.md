# Gumbel-Softmax
The aim of this repository is to document my work on using Gumbel-Softmax for training Discrete GANs/GANs for sequences. 

# Steps
## Coding
- [x] Numpy version of drawing samples from Gumbel-Softmax distribution
- [x] PyTorch version of drawing samples from GS
- [x] Categorical VAE on MNIST
- [ ] Toy example of GAN learning how to sample from continuous distribution
- [ ] Toy example of GAN learning how to sample from discrete distribution
